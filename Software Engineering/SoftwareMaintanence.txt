    Software Evolution Approaches

        - Software maintenance 
        - Architectural Transformation 
        - Software re-engineering 

    Software Change 

        - New requirements emerge when the software is used 
        - The business environment changes 
        - Errors must be repaired 
        - the performance or reliability may have to be improved

    Software change strategies 

        1. Software Maintenance 
            - Changes are made in response to changed requirements but the fundemental software structure is stable 
        2. Architectural Transformation 
            - The architecture of the system is modified 
        3. Software Re-engineering 
            - New functionality is not added to the system but it is restructured and reorganized to facilitate future changes 

    Software Maintenance

        - Modifying the program after it is used 
        - Does not normally involve major changes to the system's architecture 
        - Changes are implemented by modifying the existing components or by adding new components to the system 

    Types of Maintenance 

        - Corrective 
        - Adaptive 
        - Perfective 
        - Perventive 

        Corrective Maintenance

            - Maintenance that includes the repair of defects in an existing system 
            - Defects can stem from    
                - requirements specifications errors 
                - Design errors 
                - About 80% of all problems stem from requirements and design 
                - Coding errors 
        
        Adaptive Maintenance

            - Maintanence to adapt software to changes in the working environment
            - Invoked by 
                - Internal needs 
            - External requirements eg. Changes in law

        Perfective Maintanence
           
            - Includes all efforts to polish or refine the quality of the software or the documentation 
            - Important that the improvement reduces the system maintenance costs 

        Preventive Maintenance

            - Changes made to the system to avoid any software fault in the future   

    Maintanence Costs 

        - Greater than development costs 
        - Affected by both technical and non-technical factors 
        - Increaess as software is maintained 
        - Ageing software can have high support costs
