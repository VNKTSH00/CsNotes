CI/CD tools 

CI/CD tools can help a team to automate their devlopment, deployment, and testing 

    - Some tools specifically handle the integratoin (CI) standardized
    - Some manage development and deployment (CD)
    - others specialize in continuous testing or related functions

Best known CI/CD tools:

    - Jenkins 
    - CircleCI 
    - TeamCity 
    - Bamboo 
    - GitLab

Jenkins 

    - Jenkins is a open sources automation server that provied many plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project
    - Jenkins is designed to handle anyting from a simple CI server to a complete CD hub 
    - It is a server based applicatoin and requires a web server like Apache Tomcat
    - Since it monitors repeated tasks that arise during project development, it became popular 
    - CI/CD enables the develpoment team to handle frequent code changes for faster and more reliable product delivery 
    - CI/CD pipeline is the set of steps aimed at improving  the software delivery using the DevOps approach 
    - This entire process is automated using CI/CD tools like jenkins 

    // Features of Jenkins 

    - Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery 
    - Desitributed 
    - Easy configuration
    - easy Installation 
    - Plugins 
    - Extensible 

    // Working of jenkins

    - Jenkins runs as a server on a variety of platfoms 
    - It requires a java 8 VM and above and can run on Oracle JRE or OpenJDK
    - Jenkins runs as a Java servlet within a jetty application server 
    - It can also run on other jave application servers such as Apache Tomcat 
    - Recently, jenkins has been adapted to run in a Docker Container
    - To operate Jenkins, pipelines are created
    - Pipelines are stored in a plain text jenkinsfile and executes its commands 
    - This server also pushes the code down the pipeline from committed sources code to production runtime 

    Jenkins Pipeline 

    Jenkins Continuous Inegration pipeline consists of the follwoing set of tools

        - Continuous Integration server
        - Source Control tool 
        - Build tool 
        - Automation testing Framework 

CircleCI

    - CircleCI is a lightweight cloud based continuous integration and continuous delivery platform enables teams to deliver quality code, quickly 
    - It supports Windows, Linux, Docker and macOS and runs in the cloud or behind the firewall
    - It supporst RubyOnRails, Sinatra, Node, python, php, java 
    - teams can orchestrate complex workflows to move code through their ideal delivery pipelines 
    - It has an easily readable YAML configuration 
    - It does not require a dedicated server to run 
    - It is suitable for small projects 

    Why CircleCI

        - CircleCI clients use as their CD/CI tool, since jobs run faster and builds are well optimized 
        - CircleCi can b econfigured to run very complex pipelines efficiently 
        - It manages abut one million task per day in aid to 30,000 organizations
        - It further facilitates scalable performance-based pricing options 
        - You can SSH into any job to debug your build issues 
        - CircleCI can execute every task in a dedicated container or File

    Features of CircleCI

        1. Highly extensible with integrations 
            - You can integrate CircleCI with AWS cloud ecosystem, Azure and several other environments/ platfoms to deploy the application 
        2. Cloud, as well as self-hosted CI/CD solution 
            - CicleCI can be leveraged to orchestrate CI/CD pipeline
                1. In the CircleCI cloud hosted computes
                2. Implement CI/CD by running CircleCI on your infrastructure 
        3. Custom build environments & Language support 
            - CircleCI can be configured to imitate your target deployment environment by configuring your pipeline execution environment 
            - It supports a wide range of languages, including PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript and so on 
        4. Security and Performance 
            - With CircleCI, you have application-level security and isolated runtime environment security
            - CirlceCI is SOC II and fedRamp certified
            - Effectively uses caching to speed-up builds
    
    Working of CircleCI

        - CircleCI integrates with the code version control system
        - Every time a developer pushes code to the repository, CircleCi creates a pipeline to process the code and test it 
        - CircleCI automatically runs this newly committed code in an isolated container or a virtual machine 
        - If the committed code successfully passes the pipeline, it gets pushed to the target staging or to the deployment environment
