// Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipeline

    Continuous Delivery pipeline 

        - It is an automated expression of your process for getting softwrae version control 
        - Change in the software goes through a process and is released 
        - Process involves building the software in a reliable and repeatable manner 
        - Built software through multiple stages of test and deployment 

    Jenkins pipeline definition is writeen in text files called "jenkinsfile". This is the foundation of pipleines as code. The conitnuous deliver pipeline is a part of the application to be versioned and reviewd like any other code 

    Creating a Jenkinsfile and committing it to source control has several advantages

        - Creates a pipeline automatically to build process for all branches and pull requests 
        - Code reivew/iteration on the pipeline 
        - Audit trail for the pipeline. 
        - The pipeline has a single source of truth that can be viewed and edited by multiple project members. 
    
// Declarative vs Scripted Pipeline syntax

    1. Jenkinsfile can be writeen in Declarative and scripted types of syntaxes 
    2. Both types are contruted differently
    3. Declarative pipeline has more a recent feature of jenkins pipeline 
        - Provides rich syntax feature over pipeline code easier 
        - Designed to write and read the pipeline code easier 
        - Many syntax compnenets written into a jenkinsfile are common to both types 

// Pipeline 

    1. A pipeline is an automation engine that supports a number of automation patterns. 
    2. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto jenkins 
    3. Users can take advantage of the many features of pipeline:
        - Code
        - Durable 
        - Pausable 
        - Versatile 
        - Extensible 
    4. Allows basic forms of chaining freestyle jobs together to perform sequential tasks
    5. Pipeline makes this concept a first-class citizen in jenkins 
    6. Core jenkins value of extensibility 

    // Key aspects of jenkins Pipeline which tie in closely to pipeline syntax. 

        - Pipeline (shows the entire build process)
        - Node     (machine that executes the pipeline)
        - Stage    (describes the set of tasks performed in the pipeline)
        - Step     (single task tells what needs to be done at the particular point of time)

    Pipeline syntax

        pipeline {
            agent any 
            stages {
                stage('Build') {
                    steps {
                        //
                    }
                }
                stage('Test') {
                    steps {
                        //
                    }
                }
                stage('Deploy') {
                    steps {
                        //
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    
    // Scripted Pipeline fundementals 

        - In Scripted Pipelines syntax, one or more node blocks do the core work throughout the entire Pipeline 
        - Although this is not a mandatory requirement of Scripted Pipeline syntax, confining your Pipeline's work inside of a node block does two things: 
        - Schdules the steps contained within the block to run by adding and item to the jenkins queue. As soon as an executor is free on a node, the steps will run. 
        - Creates a workspace (a directory specific to that particular Pipeline) where work can be done on files checked out from source control. 

    Scripted pipeline syntax - Jenkinsfile ( scripted pipeline )

        node {
            stage ('Build'){
                //
            }
            stage ('Test'){
                //
            }
            stage ('Deploy'){
                //
            }
        }
