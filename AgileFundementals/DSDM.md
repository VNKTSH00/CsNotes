DSDM 

    DSDM Eigh Principles 
    DSDM Approach to Project Vaiables 
    Roles and Responsibilities 


    - Dynamic SYstem Development Method is an agile methode that cocuses on the full project lifecycle 
    - It is an iterative, incremental approach that is basd a Rapid Application Development methodology 
    - RAD uses incremetanl prototyping 
    - In DSDSm Analysis, Desing and Development phases can overlap 
    - Requirement evolve with time 
    - It provides best practice guidance for projects of all sizes and for every business sector 

DSDM Principles 

    - Focus on the business need 
    - Deliver on time 
    - COllaborate 
    - Never compromise quality 
    - Build incrementally from firm foundations 
    - Develop iteratively 
    - Communicate continuously and clearly 
    - Demonstrate control 

Understanding Project Variables - Traditional ANd DSDM Approach 

    - Projects have to balance conflicting demands 
    - Four most common demands are time, cost features and quality 
    - Trying to fix all four at the outset of a project is unrealistic 
    - In the traditional approach, to manage a project, the features are fixed, while time and cost are subject to variation 

    - DSDM approach is to manage the project, fixes time, cost and qulaity at the end of the Foundation phase, while contigency is managed b yvarying the features to be delivered 
    - A DSDM project will always deliver a viable solution on time and on cost, as long as the practives of MoSCoW and timeboxing are followed 
    - DSDM fixes quality on a project by agreeing with the acceptance creiteria for individual requirements before development commences 

DSDM Team Model 

    - Role Colour Scheme 

        1. It represents areas of interest 
        2. Orange - Business interests, roles representing the business view 
        3. Green  - Solution/technical interests, roles representing the solution/technical view
        4. Blue   - Management Interests, roles representing the management/Leadership view 
        5. Grey   - Process intersts, roles representing the process view 
        6. Mix of two colours 
    
    - Role Categories 

        1. Project-Level Roles 
            
            - In the diagram, the project-level roles like Business Sponsor, Business Visionary, Tecnical Coordinator, Project Manager and Business Analysst are the diretors, managers and coordinators for the project
            - They may be part of a project board or steering committee for the project and, collectively have authority to direct the project 

        2. Solution Development Team roles 

            - Solution Development Team roles are Business Ambassador, Solution Developer, Solution Tester, Business Analyst and Team Leader 
            - They shape and build the solution and are collectively responsible for its day-to-day Development 

        3. Supporting roles 
            
            - Supporting roles (Business Advisors, Technical Advisors, Workshop Facilitator and DSDM Coach) provide assistance and guidance to the project on an ad hoc basis throughout the lifecycle  

        4. Levels of Engagement 

            - Project-level roles need to be engaged sufficiently to ensure that the ongoing work of the project remains aligned with the business need 
            - They are more likely to be focused around the beginning and end of Timeboxes 
            - Solution Development Team roles need to be actively engaged in the project on a day-to-day basis 
            - Continuous communication and day-to-day collaboration are the keys to making good progress 
        
        5. Fulfilling the roles 

            - One DSDM role does not necessarily mean one person 
            - One person may take on one role, or one person may cover two or more roles 
            - One role may be split between two or more people 
            - However, where a role is split between individuals, it is vital that these individuals communicate and collaborate closely

            4. Assurance that the solution evolving correctly 

DSDM process 

    - DSDM integrates project management and product development inot a single process 
    - DSDM process model comprises a framework that shows the DSDM phases and how they relate to one another 

    Phases 

        1. Pre-Project Phase
        2. Feasibility Phase 
        3. Foundations Phase 
        4. Evolutionary Development Phase 
        5. Deployment Phase 
        6. Post-Project Phase 

Pre-Project Phase 

    - Pre-Project phase ensures that only the right projects are started, and that they are set up correctly, based on a clearly defined objective 

Feasibility Phase 

    - Feasibility phase is intended primarily to establish: 
        1. Whether the proposed project is likely to be feasible from a technical perspective 
        2. Whether it appears cost-effective from a business perspective 

Foundations Phase 

    - Foundations phase takes the preliminary investigation from Feasibility to the next level. 
    - It is intended to establish a fundamental understanding of the business rationale for the project, the potential solution that will be created by the project, and how the development and delivery of the solution will be managed
    - Foundations phase should last no logner than a few weeks, even for large and complex projects 
    - Detail associated with requirements, and how they should be met as part of the solution, is intentionally left until the Evolutionary Development phase of the project 
    - It may sometimes be necessary to revisit Foundations after a Deployment phase 

Evolutionary Development Phase 

    - Evolutionary Development pahse requires the Solution Development Teams to apply practices such as Iterative Development, Timeboxing and MoSCoW Prioritization 
    - Working within Timeboxes, the Solution Developmetn Team create Solution increments, iteratively exploring the low level detail of the requirements and testing continuosly as they move forward 

Development Phase 

    - Objective of the Deployment phase is to bring a baseline of the Evolving Solution into operational use 
    - The release that is deployed may be the final solution, or a subset of the final solution 
    - Deployment phase comprises three main activities: Assemble, Review and Deploy 
    - In addition, after the last release, the project is formally closed 

    Three main activities 

        1. Assemble
        2. Review 
        3. Deploy 

        Assemble 

            - Bringing together any relevant supporting information in Projects 

        Review 

            - There will be some form of "approval to deploy" 
            - This will be based on a final reivew of the solution before it oges into opertional use 
            - Ensures that the release meets out appropriate standards and it is complete 

        Deploy 

            - Physical act of putting what has been assembled into operational use 

Post-Project Phase 

    - Checks the expected business benefits over a period after live use of the solution 
    - Benefits Assessments in relation to the Business Case 
    - Needs of the Organization decides the Benefits assessment level 


DSDM Product 

    - DSDM Agile Project Framework describes a set of products to be considered, as the project proceeds 
    - Products describes the main deliverable of the Project

Objectives 

    - MoSCoW Prioritizatoin and Timeboxing 
    - Project Planning, Tracking and Control 
    - Overview of other Agile Approaches 

MoSCoW Prioritization 

    - It is also known as the MoSCoW method or MoSCoW analysis 
    - It is a popular prioritization tehcnique for managing requirements 
    - MoSCoW represents four categories of initiatives 
        1. Must-have 
        2. Should-have 
        3. Could-have
        4. Won't-have 
    - It plays a key role in Agile Project Management 

MoSCoW Prioritization 

    - Requirement are prioritized to deliver the greates and most immediate business benefits early 
    - Developers will initially try to deliver all teh Must have, Should have and Could have requirements 
    - But Should and Could requirments will be the first to be removed if the delivery imescale looks threatened 

MoSCoW Rules 

    - MoSCoW is primarily used to prioritize requirements 
    - Must have 
        1. These provides the minimum usable subset (MUS) of requirements which the project gurantees to deliver 
        2. this may be defined using some of the following: 
            - Cannot deliver on target date without this 
            - Not legal without it 
    - Should Have 
        1. Important but not vital 
        2. May be painful to leave out, but the soultion is still viable 
    - Could Have 
        1. Could have requirements are defined as: 
            - Wanted or desirable but less important
            - Less impact if left out(compared with a Should have)
    - Won't have this time 
        1. One benefit of the MoSCoW method is that it places several initiatives in teh won't-not-have category 
        2. This helps to manage expectations about what will not be included in a specific release

How to Use MoSCoW prioritization 

    1. Consider the example of a regular web application 
    2. Apply the MoSCoW prioritization to this web application 
    3. Basic functions taken from one of railsware products: 
        - A user can sign up 
        - A user can reset the password 
        - A user can choose the billing system 
        - A user can delete the account 
        - A user can open a time-tracking page 
        - A user can choose time-tracking options 
        - A user can install a mobile app version 
        - A user can choose the app's visual theme 
    4. Based on particular requirements for budget and time, we can single out the most fundemental features to be implemented in the minimum viable product 
    5. The top-priority tasks are followed by important, through not vital functionalities for the app
    6. Evolution of the app does foresee its availability on mobile devices 
        - This task is only nice-to-have at this point 
    7. Now the least-priority feature 
        - it aims at enhancing the user experience once the application is on track 

TimeBoxing 

    1. DSDM defines a Itmebox as a fixed period of time, at the end of which an objective has been met 
    2. Timebox objective is usaually completion of one or more deliverables 
    3. Optimum length for a Timebox is typically between tow and four weeks
    4. In exceptoinal circumstances, a Timebox might be as long as six weeks 
    5. It is a well-defined process to support the creation of low-level products in an iterative but controlled fashion 
    6. It incorporates frequent review points to ensure the quality of those products and the efficiency of the ieterative Development process 
    7. Timeboxing is use in combination with the MoSCoW prioritisatoin technique 

    Timeboxing Options 
    
    - DSDM recognizes two styles of Timebox: 
        1. A DSDM structured timebox 
        2. A Free Format timebox 
    
    8. Daily Stand-up

        - A key and integral part of all Timeboxes, regardless of the style adopted, is the Daily Stand-up 
        - This is the Solution Development Team's opportunity to share information across the team and to do any day-to-day re-planning and reorganizing necessary when issues occur 
        - It is important to emphasize that ongoing informal communication goes on betwen all team members during the day as needed, and not just at Daily Stand-up 

    9. Benefits of Timebox in Agile and Scrum 

        - Prioritization 
        - Focus 
        - Resources 
        - Accountability 
        - Patterns 
        - Manageable

Project Planning, Tracking and Control 

Project Planning Concepts 

        - Planning can be done during the feasibility phase, Foundation phase and deployment phase 
        - Outcome-based planning 
            1. A framework of empowerment exists in the hierarchy of a DSDM project 
            2. At the highest level, the Business Sponsor has empowered project-level roles to manage the delivery of a valuable business solution 
            3. Below that, the project-level roles have empowered Solution Development teams who self-organize to deliver the solution envisioned by the Business Visionary and Technical Coordinator 
        - Planning to sensible horizons at the right level of detail 
            1. Planning horizon defines the period of time to be covered by a plan 
            2. Two different planning horizons: 
                - Delivery Plan 
                - Timebox Plan 
        - Plan and re-plan based on best available estimates 
            1. Estimates evolve as more is understood about the thing being estimated 
            2. Early in a project, estimates will be uncertain and can only be expressed with a low confidence factor typically described by a wide range 
            3. It makes sense to evolve the Delivery plan and to refine predections of what will be delivered within the fixed timeframe of the current Project increment and perhaps the project as a whole 

Tracking and Control Concepts 

    1. Timeboxing and outcome-based Measurement 

        - Use of Timeboxes provides a structure of nested plans to support outcome-based measurement 
        - Outcome-based measurement places the primary focus of measurement on what has been delivered as part of a Solution increment at the end of a Timebox 
        - Discipline at the Timebox level is therefore the basis of control not only FOR the Timebox itself but also for the Project increment and the project as a whole 

    2. Transparency of process and progress 

        - At the Timebox level, transparency of process and progress comes from the use of a TeamBoard and the Daily stand-up
        - Sharing information in this way provides an opportunity for the collaborative, pro-active problem solving that characterizes and effective Agile Team 

    3. Responding to change 

        - Change control in a DSDM project tends to be more formal at the project level than it is at the Solution Development Team level 
        - At the project level, the Business Visionary is responsible for making sure that the solution meets the business vision and is expected to approve the high-level requirements, described in the Prioritized requirements list 
        - At the solution Development Team level, most of the change will come as a result of a deepeing understanding of a requirement 

    4. Management by exception 

        - Day-to-Day management of the work required to evoolve the solution, is left to, the Solution Development Team 
        - A degree of tolerance related to the MoSCoW prioritized scope of what is expected to be achieved is built into the objectives for a Timebox
        - Typically, the Solution Developmetn Team is empowered to de-scope an Could Have requirement without referring up to the project-level roles 
        - Any exception should be escalated to the project-level roles for guidance 

Overview of Other AGILE Appraoches 

Feature Driven Development (FDD)

    - It is an agile iterative and incremental model that focuses on progressing the featues of the developing software 
    - It is a framework that is short and iterative 
    - It emphasizes on Quality 
    - Reporting and progress tracking is necessary at all levels 
    - FDD was designed to follow a five-step development process, built largely around discrete feature projects 
        1. Develop an overall model 
        2. Build a featues list 
        3. Plan feature 
        4. Design by feature 
        5. Build by feature 
Crystal 

    - Crystal is an agile software development approach that focuses primarily on people and their interactions, when working on a project rather than on processes and tools 
    - It is made up of several agile processes, including clear, crystal yellow, crystal orange and other uniquely characterized methods 
    - Crystal agile framework is built on two core beliefs: 
        1. Teams can find ways on their own to improve an optimize their workflows 
        2. Every project is uniue and always changing, which is why that project's team is best suited to determine, how it will tackle the work 
    - Suitability of the Crystal method depends on three dimensions: 
        1. First, Team size
        2. Second, Criticality 
        3. Third, the priority of the project 
        
Scaled Agile Framework 

    - Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a set of organizational and workflow patterns for implementing agile practices at an enterprise scale 
    - This framework is a body of knowledge that includes structured guidance on roles and responsibilities, how to plan and manage the work, and values to uphold 
    - It was formed around three primary bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product develpment, and systems thinking 
    - There are four configurations in SAFe to accomodate various levels of scale: 
        1. Essential SAFe 
        2. Large Solution SAFe
        3. Portfolio SAFe and 
        4. Full SAFe 
    - Today, SAFe is one of the most popular sclaed agile delivery frameworks 

Disciplined Agile 

    - Dsiciplined agile (DA) is process-decision toolkit designed to help teams streamline their internal processes, achieve business agility and boost commercial success 
    - It is a people-first agile framework and is a hybrid of various disciplined agile delivery methodologies like XP, Scrum, Kanban
    - It provides a foundation for business enchacement by showing how various activities like software development, IT Operations, Finance, Procurement, Portfolio Management and Enterprise Architecture can collaborate and work together 
    - It provides a wide range of customised, context-sensitive ideas and helps to make better decisions
