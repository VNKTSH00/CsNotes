Kanban (Workflow management)

    Lean Principles 
    Knaban and Kanban Boards

Lean Management 

    - Lean managnement has become a universal managemen tool for dlivering value and optimizing workflows 
    - Lean management methododlogy is about continuously improving work process, purpose and people 
    - Lean can be applied to any busienss or production process, in any industry 
    - Lean methodology reiles on three simple ides: 
        1. Deliver value from the customer perspective 
        2. Eliminate Waste 
        3. Continuous imporovement 
    - Lean Management of encorages shared responsibility and shared leadership 
    - Two main pillars of Lean Methodology: 
        1. Respect for people 
        2. Continuous improvement
         
    
    //Lean management is confuses on adding value to a product/service while eliminating waste 
    //It can be the key to turn cost-intensive solutions inot profitable products 
    //Lean Enables companies to tbe more adaptable to market changes 
    //Companies willl benefit from establishing strealined processes, reduced waste, and lower operatational cost 


Pillars of Lean Management 

    1. Continuous Improvement 
        - Organizations create value constantly by learning what the customers want and need 
        - Value stream is adjust 
        - Steps that don't create value are replaced with ones that will add more value to the customer 
        - Based on customer feedback, learning is made on deciding which parts of the product and process have to be imporoved to deliver value and eliminate waste 
        - Everyone supports the continuous improvement cycle and process is develped 
    
    2. Respect for People 
        - Lean thinking acknowledges that all employees are important 
        - It understands the value of the insights that come from front line workers 
        - Respecting workers and allowing them to openly voice their ideas and concerns has additional benefits
            1. It created the sense fo lighweight leadership 
            2. Gives employees the opportunity to master their craft 
            3. Instills them a sense of purpose to understand and increase the value of their work 

Lean Principles 

    1. Identify value 
    2. Value Stream Mapping  
    3. Create Continuous Workflow 
    4. Create a Pull System 
    5. Continuous Improvement 

Identify Value 

    - A company needs to add value defined by its customers needs 
    - Any other activity or process that dosen't bring value to the end product is considered waste
    - Identify the value you want to deliver and then proceed to the next step 

Value Stream Mapping 

    - This is the point where you literally need to map the workflow of the company 
    - It has to include all actions and people involved in delivering the end product to the customer 
    - It will show you where value is being generated and in what proportion different parts of the process do or do not produce value 
    - This big-picture will enables you to detect the steps that don't bring value and eliminate them 
 
Create Continuous Workflow 

    - Developing a product/service will often include cross-functional teamwork 
    - By breking up work into smaller batches and visualizing the workflow, yo ucan easily detect and remove process roadblocks
    
Create A pull system 

    - To secure a stable workflow, make sure to create a pull system 
    - In such a system, the work is pulled only if there is a demand for it 
    - This lets you optimize resources capacity and deliver products/services only if there is an actual need 

Continuous Improvement 

    - Make sure that employees on every level are involved in continuosly improving the process 
    - There are different techniques to encorage continuous improvement 
    - For example, every team may have a Daily stand up meeting 
    - It is an easy way to process imporvement daily


Benefits of Lean Management 

    1. Better use of resources 
    2. Improving productiveity and efficiency 
    3. Focus 
    4. Smarter process 


Kanban 

    - Kanban is a ligheter weight process the applies many of the Lean and Agile values as well as subset of the Scrum values and principles
    - Kanban focuses on visualization, flow, and limiting work in progress 
    - Work items are represented visually on a Kanban board 
    - Kanban identifies poteneital bottlenecks in the process and fixes them 

    - A Kanban system ideally controls the entire value chain from the supplier to the end consumer
    - It helps to avoid supply disruption and overstocking of goods at vaious stages of the manufacturing process 
    - Kanban requires continuous monitoring of the process 
    - It serves as a real-time information repository, highlighting bottlenecks within the system 
    - You can start building the Kanban system by setting up a Kanban board with three basic columnds "Requested", "In Progress" and "Done" 

Kanban Principles 

    1. Change management Principles 
        - Start with What you do now 
        - Agree to pursue incremental, evolutional change 
        - Encorage Acts of Leadership at all levels 
    2. Service Delivery principles 
        - Focus on Customer's Needs and expectations
        - Manage the Work 
        - Rgularly Review the Network services 
    3. Change Management priciples 
        - Start with whta you do now 
            1. Kanban offers the flexibility to use the method on top of existing workflows, system and processes without disrupting what is already in place 
        - Agree to Pursue incremental, evolutionary change 
            1. Kanban method encorages continuous small incremental and evoluionary changes to the current process by implementing collaboration and feedback forms 
        - Encorage Acts of Leadership at All levels 
            1. People at all levels can provide ideas and show leadership to implement changes to continually improve the way they deliver their products and services 
    4. Service delivery Principles 
        - Focus on Customer's NEeds and Expectations 
            1. Delivering value to the customer should be at the center of each organization 
        - Manage the Work 
            1. Managing the work in your netowrk of services ensures that you empower people's abilities to self-organize around the work. 
        - Regularly reivew the Network of Services 
            1. Through the use of regular reviews of the network of services, Kanban encourages the improvement of the delivered results 



Kanban Practices 

    - Visualize the Workflow 
    - Limit work in Progress (WIP)
    - Manage Flow 
    - Make Process Policies Explicity 
    - Feedback Loops 
    - Improve collaboratively 

    Visualize the workflow 

        - To visualize your process with a Kanban system, a board with cards and columns is needed 
        - Each column on the board represents a step in your workflow 
        - Each kanban card represents a work item 
        - Each board itself represents the actual state of your workflow with all its risks and specifications 
        - This way, you can easily track progress and spot bottlenecks

    Limit Work in Progress 

        - Main concept in using Kanban and visual boards is to have every piece of work move form one opertion to the next in the most effective way possible 
        - Managers should set a work-in-progress limit 
        - This limit should equal what can be reasonably performed and managed at a given time 
        
    Manage Flow

        - Managing the flow is about managing the work but not the people 
        - Instead of micro-managing people and trying to keep busy all the time, you should focus
        
    Make Process Policies Explicit 

        - Your process should be clearly defined, published and socialized 
        - When everyone is familiar with the common goal, they would be able to wrok and make decisions regarding a positive impact 

    Feedback loops 

        - For teams and companies that want to be more agile, implementing feedback loops is a mandatroy step 
        - Kanban suggests the use of feedback loops at team level as well as service-oriented feedback loops 

    Improve Collaboratively 

        - A way to achieve continuous improvement within an organization is through collaboratively implementing changes based on scientifically proven methods, feedback and metrics 
    
Kanban Values 

    - Transparency 
    - Balance
    - Collaboration 
    - Customer Focus 
    - Workflow 
    - Leadership 
    - Understanding 
    - Agreement
    - Respect 

Benefits of Kanban 

    - Kanban Board 
    - Prioritization 
    - Accessible Information 
    - Better Delivered Product 
    - Enhanced Productivity 
    - Flexible 
    - Continuous Delivery 
    - Continuous flow of development 

Usecase of Kanban in project management cycle 

    - It can be applied to any of the five stages of Project Management 
    - It is really used during project planning and execution 
    - This methodology provides and easy-to-flow, visual representation of projects 

Kanban board 

    - A Kanban board is the key visualization tool for implementing kanban in business
    - A Kanban board can be physical or electronic
    - It gives an overview of the current work staus and simplifies team communication 
    - Goal of a Kanban system is to limit the amount of work in the process 
    - A typical Kanban board consists of one or more swim lanes and multiple columns to depict the workflow process 

    Main components 

        1. Kanban Cards
        2. Kanban Columns 
        3. Work-in-Progress Limits 
        4. Kanban Swimlanes

    Kanban cards

        - Each card on your Kanban Board represents a work item 
        - On the face of the card, you can include the details like title, card assignement, card type and due date 
        - Within the card, you can see more in-depth information about the work like card description, Attachments, Card History 

    Lanes on a Kanban board 

        - Lanes on Kaban board represent the steps in your process 
        - Each vertical lane should reflect a distinct step in your process, and move sequentially from left to right: 
            1. From "To Do" (on the far left), To "Doing," to "Done" (on the far right)
        - There are several subcategories within each of those three broader states: 
        - You can design your Kanban board to reflect each of these steps: 
            1. To Do - Unprioritized > To Do - Prioritized > Plan > Develop > Test > Lanuch > Done (pending approval) > Done - Done

Types of Kanban Board

    - Online Kanban Boards 
        1. You can use your personal device to visualize, manage your workflow and engage in real-time collaboration on various projects with the team members 

    - Agile Kanban boards 
        1. Allow teams to divide the development process into smaller, manageables segments, enabling easier changes as work progresses, and minimizing the risk of a stand-still 

    - Excel Kanban Boards
        1. One of the simplest way to present your Kanban cards is to create a board using Excel, a software program that all Microsoft Office users have access to 

    - Kanban Bin systems
        1. In certain workspace setting, 2-bin and 3-bin Kanban systems can be used to track inventory 

Using Kanban Board 

    - Spot Workflow Bottlenecks on the Kanban Boards 
    - Use the Kaban Board to limit Work In progress and focus
    - Use the Kanban Dashboard to save time wasted on Unnecessary meetings 
    - Visualize work blockers on Kanban Board 
    - Automate WOrk Processes on Agile Kanban board 


Work In Progress (WIP) and Managing Flow of work 

    Definition of WIP 

        - WIP is the number of tasks items that a team is currently workign on 
        - It frames the capacity of your team's workflow at any moment 
        - Limiting work in progress is one of the core properties of Kanban 
        - It allows managing your process in a way that creates a smooth workflow and prevents overloads 

    Use of WIP Limits 

        - Implementing WIP Limits allows you to complete single work items faster 
        - By applying WIP limit, the team has the opportunity for locating bottlenecks in their working processes before they become blockers 
        - Increments of value are delivered to customers sooner, making WIP limits a valuable tool in agile development 
        - WIP Limits point out areas of chronic idleness or overload 
        - They help the team see inefficiencies in the entire process rather than just the particular area in which they work 

    Setting up Kanban WIP limits 

        - Limiting work in progress is one of most utilized Kanban practices 
        - In Kanban, the work in progress limits have to be adjusted if needed 
        - There are three things that can be considered for setting WIP limits: 
            1. Review how to deliver services on a team level and consider how work items are ageing on your board 
            2. Workflow will be changing dynamically 
            3. Monitor team's workflow regularly and control how to limit WIP 
        - Try to respect the WIP limits you have configured 
        - It's a good practice not to exceed WIP limits 
        - It's also wise to provide an indication and a reason, whenever the WIP limit exceeds
        - Always set WIP limits according to your team's current work capacity 

    Benefits of Using WIP limits 

        - Keep Optimal Work Pace 
        - reveal Process Blockers 
        - Prevent Multitasking 
        - Deliver Value faster 

Managing Flow of work 

    - Manage your flow of work by inspecting and adapting to ensure that you minimize waste and maximise throughput 
    - You can manage your flow of work through a number of actions: 
        1. Changing your WIP limits optimize throughput 
        2. Identifying bottlenecks and removing them 
        3. Changig the steps in your flow to increase transparency and flow 
    - Changing your WIP limits to optimize throughput 
        1. Basic rules through which you can change WIP limits 
            - Do not let a single factor dictate your WIP limits 
            - Make small changes, inspect and adapt 
            - Change it collaboratively 
            - Do not do it too often or arbitrarily 
    - Identifying bottlenecks and removing them 
        1. Bottlenecks would be delays or steps that either take longer than you would want or where items are simply blocked 
            - Making bottlenecks transparent is exactly what Kanban is supposed to do 
            - When identifying bottlenecks, try to foucs on the steps and actions that need to be taken to deliver value 
    - Changing the steps in your flow to increase tranparency and flow 
        1. Finally, you can change the steps in your flow
        2. sometimes either splitting steps in the flow or merging the steps could be a good option 
        3. Don't change the steps of your flow too often 


Tracking and Monitoring Product Development 

    - Monitoring Progress and measuring performance is a key compnent of the Kanban method
    - Both are used for tracking thr project and making your process more efficient over time 
    - Metrics 
        1. Cycle time 
            - It is key metric in Kanban and it measures how much time as task spends going through your process 
        2. Throughput 
            - This metric measures the total amount of work delivered in a certain period
            - Throughput only measures completed work items 
            - It is used to track your team performance and is measured using the throughput histogram 
        3. Work In Progress
            - It imporves team's efficiency 
        4. Cumulative Flow Diagram 
            - It shows the distrubution of tasks in each of the process states, accumulating over time 
            - Each colored band indicates how many tasks are present in each state of the process at a given time 

Commonly used Boards
