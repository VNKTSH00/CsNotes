Extreme Programming 

    XP is an Agile project management methodology, that supports frequent releases in short development cycles to imporve software quality 

    It is a light weight methodology for small to medium sized teams developing software in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements 

    - Allows developers to respond to changing customer requirements withint a shorter span of time 
    - Short iterative cycles help both team members and customers 
    - It allows small to mid-sized teams to produce high-quality software

Process OF Extreme Programming 

    - Planning 
    - Designing 
    - Coding  
    - Testing 
    - Listening 

Planning 

    - It is the first stage 
    - Customer meets the development team and presents the requirements in the form of user stories
    - Team tehn estimates the stories and presents the requirements in the form of user stories 
    - Programming team prepares the plan, time and costs of carrying out the iterations 
    - Individual developers sign up for iterations 

Designing 

    - It is a part of the planning process 
    - A good design brings logic and structure to the system 
    - It is related to one of the main XP values, simplicity 
    - Using systems metaphor or standards on names, class names and methods to ensure compatiblity 
    - Using Software Class responsiblities and Collaboration (CRC) Cards to contribute ideas, and collate the best ideas into design 
    - Creating spike solutions or simple programs that explore potential solutions for a specific problem 

Coding 

    - It is the phase during which the actual code is created by impolementing specific XP practices 
    - XP programming gives priority to the actual coding over all other tasks 
    - Standards related to Coding 
        1. Developing the code based on the agreed metaphors and standards
        2. Pair programming aimed at producing higher quality code 
        3. Frequent integration of the code to the dedicated repository 

Testing 
    
    - IT is the core of Extreme Programming 
    - It is a regular activity that involves both unit test and Acceptance tests
    - Extreme program integrates testing with the development phase 
    - All codes have unit tests to eliminate bugs 
    - Acceptance test run at the completion of the coding 
    
Listening 

    - It is all about constant communication and feedback 
    - Listening to the client is very important to see what they expect the system to do 
    - Basis of feedback of Acceptance tests
    - Apart from the customer, The developer also receives feedback from the project manager 
    - Each feedback of the customer becomes the basis of a new design and the process of design-coding-tests-listening repeats itself

XP Values 

    1. Communication 
    2. Simplicity 
    3. Feedback 
    4. Respect 
    5. Courage

    - Pair Programming 
    - Collective Ownership
    - Continuous Integration 
    - 40-hour week 
    - ON-site Customer 
    - Coding standard

    Planning Game 

    - This is a meeting that occurs at the beginnning of an iteration cycle 
    - At the end of the planning game, Developers plan for the upcoming iteration and release 

    Small Releases 

    - Small releases allow developers to frequently receive feedback, detect bugs early and monitor how the product works in production 

    Metaphor

    - Metaphor stands for a simple desing that has a set of certain qualities 
    - First, the design and its structure must be understandable to new people 
    - Second, the namin of classes and methods should be coherent 

    Simple Design 

    - Best desing for software is the simplest one that works 
    - If any complexity found, it should be removed 
    - Best approach is to create code only for the features you are implementing 

    Testing 

    - Developers continually write unit tests, which need to pass for the development to continue 
    - Customers write tests to verify that the features are implemented 
    - Tests are automated 

    Refactoring 

    - To deliver business value with well-designed software in every short iteration, XP teams alos use refactoring 
    - Refactoring is about removing redundancy, eliminating unnecessary functions and increasing code coherency 

    Pair Programming 

    - This practice requires two programmers to work jointly on the same code 
    - While the first developer focuses on writing, the other one reviews code and suggests improvements 

    Collective Ownership 

    - This practice declares a whole Team's responsibility for the design of a system 
    - It encorages the team to cooperate more and feel free to bring new ideas 

    Continuous Integration 

    - Code is integrated and tested many times a day, one set of changes at a time 
    - Developers always keep the system fully integrated

    40-Hour Week 

    - XP Projectgs require developers to work fast, be efficient and sustain the product's quality 
    - In XP the optimal number of work hours must not exceed 45 hours a week 
    - One overtime, a week is possible 

    ON-Site Customer 

    - End customer should fully participate in the development 

    Coding Standard 

    - A team must have common sets of coding practices, using  the same formats and styles for code writing 
    - Code written according to the same rules encourages collective ownership

        - Oveseeing the work 

Tracker 

    - This is a optional role 
    - This role can be created on a need-only basis 
    - This is carried out by one of the developers to track of team's progress metrics
    - Some of these metrics may include the amount of time worked, amount of overtime, passing and failing tests and velocity 
    - Links customers and developers 
    - Communicates with every team member to identify roadblocks and to figure out solutions 
    - Determines how many stories are to be completed and ensures that the stories are completed within a given iteration 

    Responsibilities of Tracker 

        - Organizing meet-ups 
        - Regulating discussions 
        - Keeping track of important progress KPIs 

Feedback loops 

            -> code 
    Seconds -> Pair Programming 
    Minutes -> Unit Test 
    Hours   -> Pair Negotiation 
    day     -> Standup Meeting 
    days    -> Accpetance test 
    Weeks   -> Iteration plan 
    Months  -> Release Plan 

Unit Test 

    - It is the first Feedback loop that should be established on any project 
    - Testing gives feedback on your work in seconds 
    - You can have this feedback every time you save a code file or when you push the code in the version control system 

Pair Programming 

    - Pair programming is a powerful loop technique that provides peer feedback in seconds 
    - It lets you consolidate your knowledge and explain problems or solutions to someone else 
    - Developers receive feedback constantly by working in pairs and testing code as it is written 

Code review 

    - Code review definitely improves project quality 
    - It should be performed every time developer in the team makes a pull request directly inside the version control system 
    - It takes days, not seconds or minutes to provide the feedback 

Daily Stand-up 

    - This ceremony provides an opportunity to synchronize teammemeber efforts as well as a starting point for discussion potential improvements
    - It is a daily activity whose value hinges not only on the technical aspects but also in team communication and the big picture behind the project 
    - Managers get feedback on progress and obstacles at the daily stand up meeting 

Acceptance Test 

    - Customers get feedback on progress with acceptance test scores and demonstrations proceeding every iteration 



Continuous Process 

    1. Continuous Integration 

        - It is an extreme programming practice where members of a delivery team frequently integrate their work hourly, or at least once daily 
        - Each integration is verified by an automated build, which also performs testing, to detect any integration errors quickly and automatically 

    2. Refactoring 

        - Refactoring is the technique of improving code without changing functionality 
        - It is an ongoing process of simplification that applies to code, design, testing and XP itself 
        - A repeatable process is needed to guide refactoring 
        - Refactoring is especially necessary for Extreme Programming because they require strong customer involvement in the working process 

    3. Small Releases 

        - XP promotes small releases through continuous integration and other extremem programming practices 
        - small Releases help to deliver a small working increment (User story) in a weeks time 
        - Development Team can do a weekly review 
    
Extreme Programming versus Other Frameworks 

    1. Extreme Programming versus Scrum 
        
        - Scrum has sprints that are 2 to 4 weeks long, while XP iteratios are shorter taking 1 to 2 weeks 
        - Extreme Programming is much more flexible with possible changes within iterations, while Scrum dosen't allow any modifications after the sprint backlog is set
        - In XP the customer prioritizes features and decides on the order of their development, but in Scrum, the team itslef determines what to wrok on first 
        
    2. Extreme Programming Versus Kanban 

        - Kanban puts a lot of focus on visualizing the development process and strictly limits the number of features developed at a time 
        - Kanban is also characterizzed by a continuous workflow while XP has separate iterations 

    3. Extreme Programming versus Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)

        - In Extreme Programming, the Customer writes collects stories, whereas in DSDM, facilitated workshops identify high level requirements 
        - In XP, a group of developres estimate the size of a story in Days/Weeks/Months, while in DSDM, the project manager and Developers estimate effort derived from size using functions points
