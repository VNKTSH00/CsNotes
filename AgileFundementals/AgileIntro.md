Agile Methodology 

    - A cenceptual framework where software is developed in iterations. 
    - It satisfies the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable softwrae. 
    - Useful when there is no clarity on the client's requirement or when the client frequently changes his requirement     
    - The development activities can be carried out using the iterative actions.

    - Agile Methodology is an approach to project management that uses four values and twelve principles to organize projects 
    - It works in ongoing sprints of project planning and execution 
    - Agiles projects require an iterative approach 
    - Framworks available for Agile methods are 

        1. Scrum 
        2. Kanban 
        3. Extreme Programming 
        4. Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)
        5. Feature Driven Development 
        6. Lean Software Development  

    Requirements -> Planning -> Design -> (Development -> Testing -> QA -> Development) -> Deployment -> Maintenance 

Characteristics 

    1. Iterative and evolutionary development. 
    2. Many builds are delivered in teh iterataion process
    3. Accepts change of requirement at any stage. 
    4. Requires close communication among business group, develoment and testing people. 
    5. More focused on success than sticking with a plan. 
    6. Reduced risk and time to develop
    7. Less documentation work compared to other methodologies
    8. Requires continuous testing 

Scrum

    Scrum divides the develoment into short cycles called sprint cycles. It advocates daily team meetings for coordination and integration 

    Roles of Scrum 

        1. Product Owner (Client/Customer)
        2. Scrum Master  (Coordinator responsible for controlling, handling)
        3. Team Member   (Programmer/Designer/Tester/Architect)

    Limitations 

        1. Increase in Cost 
        2. Increase in Time 
        3. More suitable for small and fast moving projects 
        4. Needs experienced team members

Dynamic System Develoment Method (DSDM)

    - Focuses on delivering solutions quickly and efficiently 
    - RAD approach to the software development 
    - It is iterative and incremental 
    - Collaborative and co-operative approach among all stake holders is important

    Principles of DSDM 

        1. Active User Involvement 
        2. Team empowerment 
        3. Frequent delivery products 
        4. Fitness for business purpose
        5. Iterative and incremental develoment 
        6. All changes during development are reversible 
        7. Base Lining of requirements at a high level 
        8. Integrated Testing    

    Roles in DSDM 

        - Executive Sponser      (Most Senior role)
        - Visionary              (Identifying the needs of the client and communicate to the team members)   
        - Ambassador User        (Provides the Business related Information)       
        - Advisor User           (Plays the role of Testing)   
        - Project manager        (Responsible for the delivery of the project)   
        - Technical Coordinator  (Ensures the develoment teams work in a consistent way)  
        - Team Leader            (Reports to the Project Manager and ensures the coordination of the develoment team)
        - Developer              (Translates the business requirement and translates them into deployable code)
        - Tester                 (Performs the testing as accordance with the testing strategy)
        - Scribe Facilitator     (Involved in Requirement elicitation, analysis and prioritization)
        - Specialist Roles       (Added by the project manager or team leader for special roles)

    Concepts of DSDM

        - Active User involvement is imparative 
        - The focus is on ferquent delivery of products. 
        - Business suitablity is an essential criteria for accpetance of delivarables 
        - Iterative and incremental develoment is necessary to coverage on an accurate business solution
        - All changes during develoment are reversible
        - Communication and collaboratino among all the stakeholders is very important for the success of the project 
        - Requirements are the baseline at a high level 
        - Testing is integrated throughout the life cycle 

    Advantages of DSDM  

        - Users are highly involved in the development of the system 
        - Basic functionality of the software is delivered quickly 
        - On time delivery of the software 

    Limitations of DSDM 

        - Training is required for both the developers and the users 
        - Difficults in understanding the model 

Crystal Methodology 

    Crystal refers to the degree of hardness and different colours of the methodology 

        - Lighter the color lower the members in the project 
        - Darker colours indicate the need for more resources 

    Properties of Crystal Methodology 

        1. Frequent Delivery 
        2. Refective Improvement 
        3. Osmotic Communication 
        4. Personal Safety 
        5. Focus 
        6. Easy Access to Expert Users 
        7. Tehcnical Environment with Automated Tests, Configuration Management and Frequent Integration 

Feature Driven Development (FDD)

    - A short iteration framework for software Develoment 
    - Focuses on building an object model, build feature list, plan by feature, design by feature, and build by feature 
    - Emphasizes Quality at each step
    - Delivers frequent, tnagible, working results
    - Offers accurate and meanigful project progress tracking 
    - Combines many of the bets practices of other agile models 
    - Puts less focus on initial design and quickly gets to the point where the team can deliver new functionality to the project feature by feature 

    Develop an overall model -> Build a Features list -> Plan by feature -> Design by feature -> Build by feature 

Lean Software Development 

    Lean software Development is the application of lean manufacturing principles when developing software. 

    Principles of Lean software Devlopment 

    Eliminate Waste -> Build in quality -> Create knowledge -> Defer commitment -> Deliver quickly -> Respect People -> Optimize the whole -> Eliminate Waste

    Advantages of Lean Software Development 

        - Waste Elimination 
        - Product delivery on time 
        - Reduced Management time 
        - Empowerment of Delivery Team 
      
Extreme Programming (XP)

    XP is a lighweight (agile) Process 

        - Instead Of excessive documentations, XP gives more importance to customer feedback 
        - Embraces changes: iterates often design and redesign, codes and tests frequently, keeps the customer involved 
        - Deliveres software to the customer in short (2 week) Iterations 
        - Eliminates defects early, Thus reducing costs 

    Values of Extreme Programming 

        - Communication 
        - Simplicity 
        - Feedback 
        - Courage 
    
    Principles of XP 

        - Rapid Feedback 
        - Assume simplicity 
        - Incremental Changes 
        - Embrace Change 
        - Quality Work 

    Advantages of XP 

        - Employee Satisfaction 
        - Lesser Risks 
        - Cost Saving 
        - Resilience 
        - Robustness 

    Limitations of XP 

        - XP is geared towards a single project, developed and maintained by a single team, 
        - XP will not work in an environment where: 
            1. A customer or the manager insists on a complete specification or design before they begin programming 
            2. Programmer are separated geographically 
        - XP has not been proven to work with systems that have scalability issues
