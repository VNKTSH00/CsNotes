Git 

// Three main areas

1. Working Directory
2. Staging index
3. Repository

// Version Control System (VCS) or Source Code Manager (SCM)

    A VCS allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state,
review changes made over time, see who last modified something that might be causing
a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. 

// Commit (SnapShot)

    Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini file system.
Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a
picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that
snapshot. 

// Repository (Repo)

    A directory that contains your project work, as well as a few files which are used 
    to communicate with Git. Repositories can exist either locally on your computer or 
    as a remote copy on another computer.

// Working Directory

    The files that you see in your computer's file system. When you
open your project files up on a code editor, you're working with files in the Working
Directory. This is in contrast to the files that have been saved (in commits!) in the repository.
When working with Git, the Working Directory is also different from the command line's
concept of the current working directory which is the directory that your shell is
"looking at" right now.

// Checkout

    When content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory. It
is possible to checkout many things from a repository; a file, a commit, a branch, etc. 

// Staging Area or Staging Index or Index

    A file in the Git directory that stores
information about what will go into your next commit. You can think of the staging area
as a prep table where Git will take the next commit. Files on the Staging Index are
poised to be added to the repository.

// SHA

    A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit. It is a 40-character string
composed of characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or
directory structure in Git. "SHA" is shorthand for "SHA hash". A SHA might look like this: 
moving updated/changed files

// Branch

    A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the
main line of development. This alternative line of development can continue without
altering the main line.
Going back to the example of save point in a game, you can think of a branch as where
you make a save point in your game and then decide to try out a risky move in the
game. If the risky move doesn't pan out, then you can just go back to the save point. The
key thing that makes branches incredibly powerful is that you can make save points on
one branch, and then switch to a different branch and make save points there, too
Working Directory -> Staging Index -> Repository (Saved area)

// Git Id

Git creates a seven digit ID(SHA) for every commit inorder to access previous versions

//Configuring the terminal

cd -> to go to home directory
mv -> moving directory can be also used to change the directory or filename

GIT Bash Commands

// git init  (repo name)            - create a new repository in local computer
// git clone (url of the project)   - clone or copy a repository from web
// git status                       - to check the status of the repository

// ls                               - used to list all the files and directories
// mkdir                            - used to create a new directory
// cd                               - used to change directory
// git -rf                          - used to remove git files and repositories

// git log                          - to view the logs of all the commits made
// git log --oneline                - To view all the list of commits made  
// git log -p                       - To view where the changes were made in the commit (patch command)
// git log --decorate               - to view the hidden elements like tags in the command line 

// git push [variable name]         - sends the commited changes of master branch to the remote repository  
// git push --all                   - pushes all branches to the remote repository 

// git add  (fileName)              - adds file to staging area
    git add .                       - to add all the repos 
// git commit -m (message)          - to records or snapshots the file permanently for version history 
// git diff                         - shows the differences which are not yet staged 

// git tag -a (tagName) (SHA)       - to adds to specific commits (-a = this flag tells Git to create and annotated flag)
    git tag                         - displays all the tags available in the repository 
    git tag -d (name)               - to delete a tag
    git tag --delete (name)         - to delete a tag
     git tag -a beta (tagName)      - to add tag to the recent commit 
// git branch                       - allows multiple lines of development 
// git checkout (branch)            - to switch from one branch to another 
// git merge                        - combines changes on different branches
